# Suppose that a machine sells bottles of Coca-Cola (Coke) for 50 cents and only accepts coins in these denominations:
# 25 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents.

# In a file called coke.py, implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin,
# one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due. Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents,
# output how many cents in change the user is owed. Assume that the user will only input integers,
# and ignore any integer that isnâ€™t an accepted denomination.

        coin = get_coin()
        total += coin
    
    print(f"Change owed: {total - COKE_PRICE} cents")
